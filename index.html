            I’m very close with my family. I love family time, whether that's
            sharing a meal, having game night, or movie night, or just being
            lazy together. I have seven siblings, and we all have a strong bond.

          <p class="card-description">
            In my free time, I enjoy reading, drawing, and painting—especially
            sketching, which has always been my favorite creative outlet. I’m
            drawn to activities that challenge me to think creatively or learn
            something new, and reading has been a constant part of my life since
            childhood. I also love solving problems and tackling complex
            puzzles, and it’s the combination of this analytical side with my
            creativity that led me to pursue software development.

            I love traveling. The world is larger than our imaginations and I
            love to explore it. The last place I visited in the United States
            was Miami and outside of the United States, Costa Rica.

            I’m currently learning software engineering and working toward
            starting a career in tech. I’m interested in building things through
            code and using what I learn to solve real-world problems.
